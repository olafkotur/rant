# Rant
Fetches a random rant from <https://devrant.com/feed> and logs it to your console. Something to do whilst I wait for `yarn start` to finish.

## Setup and run
* `yarn | npm i` install dependencies
* node rant.js

## Suggested Use
* Add an alias `rant` to your bash profile to trigger this from wherever you are in your directories
* Example: Directory path will vary on where you place your clone
```
alias rant="node ~/Development/rant/rant.js"
```
